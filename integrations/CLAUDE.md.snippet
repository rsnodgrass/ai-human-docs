## Document Audience

Before editing any file, check for `<!-- doc-audience: ... -->` on line 1:

- `human, preserve-voice` — Do NOT edit, expand, or rephrase
- `human, ai-editable` — May edit, but preserve concise human voice
- `ai` — Edit freely, be verbose and explicit

**Directory routing:** Files in `docs/human/` default to preserve-voice. Files in `docs/ai/` are editable.

**Commit messages:** When editing docs, list which files you edited:
```
Docs edited:
- path/to/file.md (ai)
```

See [ai-human-docs](https://github.com/modern-tooling/ai-human-docs) for full specification.
